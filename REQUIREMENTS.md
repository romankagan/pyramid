Please write a web service that accepts http requests and returns responses based on the following problem statement. You may define the request and response format as you see fit based on the problem statement.
Problem statement: Accept a string as input and return a response indicating whether a word is a pyramid word.

A word is a ‘pyramid’ word if you can arrange the letters in increasing frequency, starting with 1 and continuing without gaps and without duplicates.
Examples:
banana is a pyramid word because you have 1 'b', 2 'n's, and 3 'a's.
bandana is not a pyramid word because you have 1 'b' and 1 'd'.

You can use any language. When completed, please upload to a public repository, such as GitHub, and provide us with the link.
